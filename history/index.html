				<p class="p__text col-2">The Galapagos are an oceanic archipelago, ie that there was never connections between continents and these landmasses, form an isolated group of 128 islands located in the Pacific Ocean about 1000 km west of the coast of Ecuador, and is located in the Ecuador line and extends over an area of more than 7900 km². <br> <br> The islands have flat edges and a mountainous interior whose high craters are highlights, rising to 1707 meters. Several volcanoes are still active. <br> <br> The Galapagos are still a region with intense volcanic activity. There have been more than 50 eruptions since the 16th century latest Las occurred in 1995 in Fernandina and Isabela in 1998. <br>
					<br>Many theories attempt to explain the origin of the Galapagos Islands, but modern studies have shown that emerged from the seabed by successive eruptions of underwater volcanoes that rise above the Galapagos platform.

				<p class="p__text col-2">The Galapagos has no indigenous human population, not least because most of the islands are lacking in fresh surface water and ground cultivable.Se think that early humans who visited the islands were Incas, led by Túpac Yupanqui in the 15th century.<br> <br> The islands are uninhabited at the time when the Bishop of Panama, Tomas de Berlanga, were discovered by accident while sailing to Peru. Seeing the giant turtles that inhabited the islands, called them Galapagos. The first maps were drawn in 1574, although indigenous say that American Indians and knew before, recalling the story of Tupac Yupanqui. <br> <br> Over the next three centuries, the islands were occupied by many pirates who gave them the names of their kings and captains. It is only in 1892 when the Ecuadorian government gave them their present names. The whalers also often cast anchor in the islands, and carried on their turtles vessels used as reservoirs of fresh meat, which almost decimated the local species. So this region was used as a supply base for long.</p>

				<h2 class="title-jumbo-light col-2">THE <span>THEORY</span></h2>
				<p class="p__text col-2">The Galapagos Islands have one of the most important environmental milestones in the history of the environment, they found evidence for Darwin's theory of evolution, probably the scientific theory that has changed the world view. Darwin at that time was a young man who had undertaken an exploratory trip, travel and above all the experience and the collection of specimens of animals of the Galapagos Islands led to the development and crystallization of a set of ideas that would lead to the theory of developments for 5 weeks.<br> <br> Darwin fascinated by geographical isolation and distribution of species. On the voyage on the Beagle, published in 1845, he documented the natural history epic. His speech on the theory of evolution was not published until 1859, when the first edition of On the Origin of Species emerged in England and changed the study of evolutionary biology. In 1959 the Galapagos National Park was declared to protect more than 97% of the land area of the islands and thus restrict the establishment of settlements in the archipelago. In 1964 the advice and international cooperation was sought, through an agreement signed with the Charles Darwin Foundation, which established the Charles Darwin Research Station and set Scientific inventories and actions for the conservation of the archipelago.<br> <br> International recognition of the exceptional value of the Archipelago, in 1979 the Heritage Committee of the United Nations-UNESCO designated the Galapagos Islands as a World Heritage Site; and later in 1985 also declared the Archipelago Biosphere Reserve.</p>

					<h2 class="title-jumbo-light col-2">WEATHER</h2>
					<p class="p__text col-2">The Galapagos comprise two stations, which are determined by the variable presence of the Humboldt Current, which is an ocean current that brings fresh water from the south. This stream cools and dries the climate of the Galapagos. This trend is the first season, which lasts from July to October. <br> <br> When these currents weaken, warmer, typical of tropical climates, water coming from the north and usher in the hot, rainy season during the rest of the year. <br> <br>Temperature has a particular behavior, since for every 100 m of elevation decreases by 1 ° C. Likewise, rainfall varies from 350-1800 mm, at altitudes ranging from 0 to 700 meters above sea level. The heat decreases in late April, when a period of cooler weather and not so cold starts.</p>
